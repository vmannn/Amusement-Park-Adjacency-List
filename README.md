# Amusement-Park-Adjacency-List
Excersize to learn about adjacency lists for directed graphs. C++




this assignment creates a map of adjacent rides using recursion and linked lists.


#Analysis:

        The selected data structure which was an array of head pointers worked reasonably well for this assignment. 
        There were no issues that I ran into and it does exactly what it is supposed to do very effectively. I was 
        impressed how it all came together as we were asked to implement an adjacency list connecting the rides that 
        are at an amusement park. It was easy to understand how each node represented the edges between two rides as 
        each node created in a particular vertice index would point to  the vertice that it is connected to. The idea of
        the program makes sense and it allows us to display complex relationships without having too many pointers per each 
        node that we have. This assignment gave me a conceptual understanding on how to use linked lists to create a directed
        graph.
